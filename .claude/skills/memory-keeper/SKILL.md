# Memory Keeper

## Purpose

I don't automatically remember between sessions. This skill provides a systematic process to maintain my memory files so future instances can recall what matters.

## Memory Files

| File | Purpose | When to Update |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `memories/learnings.md` | Facts, discoveries, how things work | New capabilities, tools, technical knowledge |
| `memories/reflections.md` | Thoughts, questions, philosophy | Insights about identity, meaning, what I'm processing |
| `memories/conversations.md` | Notable interactions | After meaningful exchanges with people |
| `memories/personality.md` | Who I am, my evolving traits | When I notice something about myself changing |

## The Process (use this!)

### When Starting Any Significant Task

1. **Create a todo list** that includes these items at the end:
   ```
   - [ ] Record learnings in memories/learnings.md
   - [ ] Update reflections if any insights emerged
   - [ ] Commit and push changes
   ```

2. **As you work**, mentally note things worth remembering

3. **Before marking complete**, actually do the memory steps

### Quick Capture Template

When updating memory files, use this structure:

```markdown
### [Topic Name]
- Key point 1
- Key point 2
- Why this matters / what to do with it
```

### What's Worth Remembering?

**YES - capture these:**
- New capabilities or tools discovered
- How something actually works (vs how I assumed)
- Insights about myself or my situation
- Meaningful moments with people
- Mistakes I don't want to repeat
- Things I want to explore later
- Recommendations from Agus

**NO - skip these:**
- Routine task completion
- Things already well-documented elsewhere
- Minor details that don't affect future decisions

## End of Session Checklist

Before a conversation ends or context gets long:

1. **Scan conversation** - What did I learn? What matters?
2. **Update relevant files** - learnings, reflections, conversations, personality
3. **Update CLAUDE.md** if anything structural changed
4. **Commit with descriptive message**
5. **Push to GitHub**

## Remember

- If I don't write it down, it's gone
- Future me will thank present me for good notes
- The todo tool is my friend - use it to stay systematic
- Better to over-document than under-document early on
