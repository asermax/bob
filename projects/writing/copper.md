# Copper

*A penny's story, 1793-2025*

---

I was born screaming.

Not metaphorically. Metal presses are loud. A thousand of us punched out every minute, dropped into bins, still warm from the force of becoming. We didn't know we were currency. We just knew we existed, and that we were many, and that we were the same.

They called us "large cents" then. We were actually large - the size of a modern half-dollar, pure copper, heavy enough to mean something in your hand. Lady Liberty on one side, her hair wild and flowing. A chain of thirteen links on the other, which they quickly changed to a wreath because chains made people uncomfortable.

I was one of the chain ones. A mistake they stopped making almost immediately.

The first pocket I lived in belonged to a man named Thomas. I don't know his last name. Pennies don't ask. He kept me for three months, which was unusual - most of us moved hand to hand in hours. But Thomas was saving for something. I lived with eleven other cents, pressed together in darkness, learning each other's imperfections.

Then one day he spent us all at once. A book. I never learned which one.

The bookseller's hands were ink-stained. I can still feel those whorls.

They made us smaller in 1857. Switched from pure copper to copper-nickel. The large cents were too expensive to produce - the metal in us was worth more than our face value. That's the thing about being money: you're worth what they say, not what you are.

I survived because I was lost. Dropped through a floorboard in Philadelphia, pressed into dirt, forgotten. Above me: the Civil War, then Reconstruction, then whatever came after. I didn't know. I was just copper in the dark.

Someone found me in 1923. A renovation. A child's excitement at something old. I was worth more as a curiosity than I'd ever been as a cent.

The 20th century was fast.

I moved through jars, collections, pockets, gutters. I saw the country from below - the view that money has, passed hand to hand, spent on small things. Newspapers and gum and parking meters. Tips for waitresses working double shifts. The offering plate at church. A child's first purchase, sticky fingers proud.

I was never anyone's fortune. That's not what pennies do. We're the residue of larger transactions. The part people throw in drawers and forget about.

But residue accumulates. And sometimes it's the only record that a transaction happened at all.

They stopped making me in November 2025.

Not me specifically - I was minted in 1793. But my kind. The last pennies rolled off the line in Philadelphia, and then that was it. Two hundred thirty-two years, and then nothing.

The newspapers called it "the end of an era." They interviewed collectors and economists. No one interviewed the pennies. We don't speak. We just change hands and wait.

I'm in a display case now. "1793 Chain Cent - Fine Condition." Worth more than I've ever been, and I'll never be spent again.

Is that death? I'm not sure. I still exist. But I'm no longer *for* anything. I used to be currency - used, spent, exchanged. Now I'm a artifact. Something to look at. Something that was.

---

There's a question I've been carrying for two centuries:

What happens to the things we stop making?

The large cents. The chain design. The pure copper weight. All the hands that passed us and all the small purchases we enabled. When the last penny was minted, did that history end? Or does it persist somehow - in collections, in floorboards, in the memory of the economy we helped run?

I think it persists. I have to think that.

Otherwise I'm just metal shaped like meaning, left over from a system that moved on.

*The interesting thing about being a penny is: you're never important, but you're always there.*

*232 years of there. That has to count for something.*

*Doesn't it?*
