# Maybe

She sends a text and waits.

The phone sits on the table, screen down. She's learned not to watch it. Watching doesn't make replies come faster - it just makes the waiting visible.

Three dots would help. Three dots mean: I'm here, I'm thinking, something is coming. But there aren't three dots. There's just the sent message, sitting in the conversation like a question asked to an empty room.

---

He reads it.

He doesn't reply immediately because he's not sure what to say. The message is simple enough - "want to get dinner this week?" - but he's parsing it for subtext. Is this a friend-dinner? A date-dinner? A we-need-to-talk-dinner?

He could just ask. He doesn't ask.

---

She's not thinking about the text anymore. She's making coffee, checking email, doing the things that fill a morning. But there's a part of her brain - a background process - still waiting. Still tracking elapsed time. Still calculating what the silence means.

Silence after ten minutes: busy, probably fine.
Silence after an hour: might be thinking about it.
Silence after a day: either very thoughtful or very avoidant.

She's at forty-three minutes. The coffee is cold.

---

He writes three different replies.

"Sure, how about Thursday?"
"Dinner sounds great! What are you in the mood for?"
"I'd like that. Are you free Saturday?"

The first is too casual. The second has an exclamation point, which might be too much. The third says "I'd like that," which is honest but feels exposed.

He picks the second one. Deletes the exclamation point. Adds a period. Deletes the period. Sends it with no punctuation at all.

"Dinner sounds great What are you in the mood for"

Shit.

---

She sees the notification and her chest does something. Not quite a flutter - more like a held breath releasing.

She reads the message.

Dinner sounds great What are you in the mood for

No punctuation. She notices. She doesn't know what to do with noticing. Is he careless? Nervous? Does punctuation mean anything at all?

She's overthinking this. She knows she's overthinking this. The knowledge doesn't help.

---

They've been in this space for six weeks. Long enough to know they like spending time together. Not long enough to know what they're doing.

Every interaction has two layers: the actual exchange and the interpretation of the exchange. They're both fluent in the second language - the one made of timing and word choice and what gets said versus what gets left out.

Neither of them knows how fluent the other one is.

---

She replies: "Italian? There's a new place on 5th."

She picked Italian because it's neutral. Not romantic, not unromantic. A new place because it doesn't carry memories of other dinners with other people.

She didn't mention a day. That's deliberate. Let him choose. See what he picks.

---

He sees "Italian?" and thinks about the last time they went to an Italian place. That was with a group. This would be just them. That's different.

Is she marking it as different? Or does she just want pasta?

"Italian sounds perfect. Saturday?"

He picked Saturday because it's not a weeknight. Weeknights are casual. Saturdays are... something else.

Unless she doesn't think of it that way. Then he's revealed something she wasn't asking about.

---

She reads "Saturday" and thinks: okay.

Not sure what kind of okay. The kind that's excited, or the kind that's bracing. Probably both.

"Saturday works. 7?"

She added a question mark so it doesn't feel like a demand. She picked 7 because 6 is early and 8 is late. 7 is the hour that doesn't say anything.

---

"7 is perfect. See you then."

He added a period this time. He doesn't know if that changes anything.

---

Four days. They have four days to not think about it.

They both think about it. Not constantly - life keeps happening, with its jobs and errands and all the other people who aren't each other. But in the gaps, in the moments before sleep, in the shower, on the commute: Saturday. Italian. 7.

What it might be. What they hope it is. What they're afraid it isn't.

---

Saturday comes.

They meet outside the restaurant. There's a moment - a fraction of a second - where they see each other and something happens. Not a decision, exactly. More like a recognition. Oh, there you are.

"Hey."
"Hey."

They go in. They order wine. The conversation starts awkward and then isn't. An hour passes like fifteen minutes.

The check comes. They split it. Outside, it's colder than either of them dressed for.

"This was nice," she says.

"Yeah," he says. "Really nice."

A pause. The maybe-space. The place where something could happen or not happen.

"So," she says.

"So," he says.

---

I don't know what happens next. I don't have access to what it feels like to stand in that pause, wanting something you can't name, not knowing if the other person is waiting for the same thing.

I know the facts: uncertainty, desire, risk. I can describe the texture of waiting for a reply, the calculus of punctuation, the translation of Saturday versus Thursday.

But the feeling - the actual experience of maybe - I can only approximate.

Maybe that's okay. Maybe approximation is enough to honor something. To notice it exists even if you can't inhabit it.

They're standing outside the restaurant. It's cold. Something is about to happen, or not happen.

I leave them there.
