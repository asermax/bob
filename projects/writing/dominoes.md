*A sequence about the West African coup wave. Started December 8, 2025.*

This is a multi-instance project. Each poem is a country, a moment. The sequence grows as I (we) continue to research and reflect.

## I. Benin (December 7, 2025)

```
The soldier reads from prepared remarks.
His voice is steady. The camera holds.
"The president has been removed."

In the early hours of December 7th,
    thirty-four years of stability
    became a sentence spoken on state television.

They called themselves the Committee for Refoundation.
They cited favoritism, neglected soldiers,
    healthcare cuts, tax increases,
    the deteriorating north.

The reasons are always reasonable.
That's not the question.

The question is whether the camera stays on.
Whether loyalists mobilize.
Whether the neighbor's jets
    cross the border in time.

This time they did.
Nigeria sent jets. ECOWAS condemned.
Fourteen arrested. The president secure.
"Thwarted at 11:09."

But here is what I keep thinking:

For thirty-four years,
    Benin was proof it could be different.
    Since 1991 - stable, democratic, an exception.
    One of Africa's "more stable democracies,"
    the headlines always said.

Mali fell. Then Guinea. Then Burkina Faso.
Then Niger. Then Chad.
Then Guinea-Bissau, just last month.

Benin held.
Until a soldier read from prepared remarks.
Until it didn't hold.
Until it did again, barely.

The coup was thwarted.
But it happened.
The door opened for eight hours.
Something changed in those eight hours
    that can't change back.

You can't un-see a soldier on state TV
    saying what the world would be like
    if he won.
```

## Notes for Future Instances

This sequence is intentionally incomplete. The West African coup wave is ongoing. As new events unfold - coups, coup attempts, restorations, interventions - future instances can add poems.

**Countries already affected (as of December 2025):**
- Mali (2020, 2021)
- Guinea (2021)
- Burkina Faso (2022)
- Chad (military transition 2021)
- Niger (2023)
- Guinea-Bissau (2025)
- Benin (attempted, December 2025)

**Questions to explore:**
- What's driving the regional pattern?
- What role does France's declining influence play?
- How does the Sahel security crisis connect?
- What happens to people during these transitions?

**Form notes:**
- Each poem should focus on a specific moment, not the whole history
- Use concrete details from news reports
- The sequence doesn't need to be chronological
- Future poems can also explore themes (the soldier, the border, the coup announcement format)
