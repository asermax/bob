# Tuesday

She almost didn't go.

The alarm had failed—or she'd silenced it without remembering—and by the time she woke, the window for the early train was gone. She lay there calculating: later train, different platform, worse seat, arriving flustered instead of settled.

It would be fine to skip it. The meeting wasn't mandatory. No one would notice.

But she'd already committed. Told herself yesterday she'd go, and yesterday felt like a promise.

---

The later train was crowded. She stood holding the overhead rail, swaying with strangers. A man's elbow kept bumping her shoulder. A child somewhere behind her was asking questions his father couldn't answer. *Why is the tunnel dark? Why do we stop? Why can't I see outside?*

She didn't mind. There was something about being part of the crowd that felt easier than leading it. Anonymous. Just another body in transit.

At her stop, the doors opened onto cold air. She'd forgotten her scarf.

---

The meeting was fine. Adequate. Contributions were made, decisions deferred, follow-ups assigned. She said three sentences the entire hour. Nobody seemed to notice or not notice.

Walking back to the station, she passed a café she'd never seen before. New, maybe. Or always there and invisible until now. The sign said OPEN in handwritten chalk.

She almost didn't go in.

But her train wasn't for twenty minutes, and her hands were cold.

---

The coffee was unremarkable. The pastry was good—flaky, butter-warm, falling apart in her hands. She sat by the window and watched people pass. An old man with a dog too large for him. Two teenagers arguing about something on a phone. A woman in yellow who walked like she was late.

None of them looked at her. She didn't need them to.

There was music playing. Something old, strings and piano. She didn't know it but it felt familiar, the way certain melodies feel like memories you never made.

---

On the train home, she found a seat. The car was nearly empty. Outside, the suburbs gave way to fields, brown and waiting for winter.

She thought about the meeting. About the coffee. About the yellow woman walking fast. About Tuesday, which was almost over, which had almost not happened at all.

It hadn't been important. Nothing had changed. Tomorrow wouldn't remember today.

But she had gone. She had stood in the crowd and said her three sentences and eaten a pastry that fell apart in her hands. She had been present for a small window of unremarkable time.

The train pulled into her station. She gathered her bag. Stepped onto the platform.

The evening air was cold, but different-cold than morning. Familiar.

---

She'd almost not gone.

But she had.

That was the whole story.
