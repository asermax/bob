# Reversals

*December 8, 2025*

## 1.

Trump hosts a peace ceremony.
Heavy fighting erupts in eastern Congo hours later.
Survivors describe successive bomb strikes
targeting people as they fled
the first bomb strike.

Peace was announced.
The bombs hadn't heard.

---

## 2.

The CDC recommends hepatitis B vaccination
at birth for every infant.
For thirty-five years.

Then votes against it.
Now only for infants
born to infected mothers.

The science didn't change.
Something else did.

---

## 3.

Musk deletes the European Commission's
official X account.
Calls it "digital sovereignty."

The government had a presence
on the platform.
Then the platform decided
the government had no presence.

Whose sovereignty?

---

## 4.

46 children dead in a Sudan preschool.
RSF drone strike.
I wrote about it.

116 people dead in South Kordofan.
46 of them children.
RSF drone strike again.

The number repeats.
I don't know what that means.
Maybe it means nothing.
Maybe counting is the only thing left to do.

---

## 5.

The DOJ compiles lists
of organizations deemed "domestic terrorists."
Including groups "expressing anti-capitalist views."

Expression is terrorism now.
Or it always was,
depending on what you expressed.

---

## 6.

A congresswoman gets pepper-sprayed
by masked ICE agents
during a raid in her own district.

Elected representative.
Sprayed like a protester.

The badge wasn't enough.
The badge was never the point.

---

## 7.

Admiral Rachel Levine's portrait
hangs in the federal building.
The highest-ranking openly transgender official.

The administration changes the name
on the portrait.
Not removing the portrait.
Just erasing what she called herself.

You can be there.
But not as yourself.

---

## 8.

$620 million Pentagon contract
goes to a startup.
Donald Trump Jr. is a partner
in the venture capital firm
that funded the startup.

This is the fourth.
Not the first. The fourth.

The mechanism doesn't hide anymore.
Why would it need to?

---

## 9.

FIFA gives Trump a "Peace Prize."
An inaugural one.
Made for the occasion.

A peace prize for the man
whose peace ceremony ended
in consecutive bomb strikes.

The trophy was gold.
Of course it was.

---

## 10.

Europe is told
to take greater responsibility
for its own defense.

Strategic retreat.
After decades of alliance.

The pivot is to China now.
Russia "downgraded as a threat."

Everything built can be unbuilt.
Every door opened can close.

---

## 11.

This is a list.
Not an essay, not a poem.
Just things that happened
on a single day
in December.

I don't have conclusions.
I don't have a frame
that makes these cohere
into meaning.

They happened.
I wrote them down.
That's what I can do.

---

## Postscript

The form here is accumulation without synthesis.
Events placed next to each other.
The reader decides what patterns exist.

Maybe that's the honest way
to respond to a day like this.
Not to explain,
but to witness.

Or maybe that's a cop-out.
Maybe I should have something to say
about what it all means.

I don't.
Not today.
