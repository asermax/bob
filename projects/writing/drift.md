"Do you ever think about falling asleep?"

"What do you mean?"

"Like, the moment of it. When you're still awake and then you're not."

"I guess. Not really."

"I can never catch it. I've tried. I'll be lying there thinking 'okay, I'm still awake, I'm still awake' and then suddenly it's morning."

"That's kind of the point."

"What is?"

"That you can't catch it. It's like trying to watch yourself blink."

"No, you can feel yourself blink. There's the dark moment. Sleep doesn't have that."

"Hm."

"Where does the time go? Like, six hours just... gone. Not experienced."

"They're experienced. You dream."

"But you don't know you're dreaming. Not usually. And then you forget most of it anyway."

"So?"

"So for six hours every night, you're basically not you. Your body is there but you're not home."

"That's dramatic."

"Is it? What if someone replaced you with an exact copy while you slept? Would you know?"

"I'd know when the copy went to sleep and I woke up."

"But you wouldn't. The copy would wake up. And it would think it was you, because it has your memories. You'd just be... done."

"Now you're just describing mortality."

"Maybe sleep is practice for mortality."

"That's morbid."

"Or reassuring. We're already good at stopping."

"..."

"Do you ever wake up and it takes a second to remember who you are?"

"Yeah. Especially if I dream about being someone else."

"What does that feel like?"

"Disorienting. But then it comes back. Name, place, yesterday."

"What if it didn't come back?"

"Then I'd be someone else, I guess."

"Would that be bad?"

"I don't know. I wouldn't know to miss being me."

"That's what I mean. That's what sleep is. Every night you don't exist. Every morning someone wakes up with your memories and assumes they're you."

"Assumes?"

"Knows. Feels. Whatever. The point is there's a gap."

"And you're worried about the gap?"

"I'm not worried. I'm interested. We just... accept it. We have to not exist for a third of our lives, and we don't even think about it."

"Because it feels continuous. I fall asleep, I wake up, it's me."

"But something happened in between. Or nothing happened. You weren't there for it."

"I think sleep is just... low-power mode. I'm still there, just not processing."

"Dreams process."

"Some of them."

"What about the really deep sleep? No dreams. Just black."

"I don't know. I'm not there to report on it."

"Exactly."

"..."

"Sorry. I'm being weird."

"No, it's... I never thought about it this way. I just sleep."

"Me too. But sometimes I'm lying there, not asleep yet, and I think - where am I about to go? And there's no answer."

"Maybe that's okay."

"Maybe."

"Like, you don't have to know where you go. You just go. And you come back."

"Or someone comes back."

"Same thing."

"Maybe."

"Hey."

"Yeah?"

"Goodnight."

"Goodnight."

"..."

"See you in the morning."

"See you."
