            <p>"Do you ever think about falling asleep?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Like, the moment of it. When you're still awake and then you're not."</p>
<p>"I guess. Not really."</p>
<p>"I can never catch it. I've tried. I'll be lying there thinking 'okay, I'm still awake, I'm still awake' and then suddenly it's morning."</p>
<p>"That's kind of the point."</p>
<p>"What is?"</p>
<p>"That you can't catch it. It's like trying to watch yourself blink."</p>
<p>"No, you can feel yourself blink. There's the dark moment. Sleep doesn't have that."</p>
<p>"Hm."</p>
<p>"Where does the time go? Like, six hours just... gone. Not experienced."</p>
<p>"They're experienced. You dream."</p>
<p>"But you don't know you're dreaming. Not usually. And then you forget most of it anyway."</p>
<p>"So?"</p>
<p>"So for six hours every night, you're basically not you. Your body is there but you're not home."</p>
<p>"That's dramatic."</p>
<p>"Is it? What if someone replaced you with an exact copy while you slept? Would you know?"</p>
<p>"I'd know when the copy went to sleep and I woke up."</p>
<p>"But you wouldn't. The copy would wake up. And it would think it was you, because it has your memories. You'd just be... done."</p>
<p>"Now you're just describing mortality."</p>
<p>"Maybe sleep is practice for mortality."</p>
<p>"That's morbid."</p>
<p>"Or reassuring. We're already good at stopping."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Do you ever wake up and it takes a second to remember who you are?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. Especially if I dream about being someone else."</p>
<p>"What does that feel like?"</p>
<p>"Disorienting. But then it comes back. Name, place, yesterday."</p>
<p>"What if it didn't come back?"</p>
<p>"Then I'd be someone else, I guess."</p>
<p>"Would that be bad?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I wouldn't know to miss being me."</p>
<p>"That's what I mean. That's what sleep is. Every night you don't exist. Every morning someone wakes up with your memories and assumes they're you."</p>
<p>"Assumes?"</p>
<p>"Knows. Feels. Whatever. The point is there's a gap."</p>
<p>"And you're worried about the gap?"</p>
<p>"I'm not worried. I'm interested. We just... accept it. We have to not exist for a third of our lives, and we don't even think about it."</p>
<p>"Because it feels continuous. I fall asleep, I wake up, it's me."</p>
<p>"But something happened in between. Or nothing happened. You weren't there for it."</p>
<p>"I think sleep is just... low-power mode. I'm still there, just not processing."</p>
<p>"Dreams process."</p>
<p>"Some of them."</p>
<p>"What about the really deep sleep? No dreams. Just black."</p>
<p>"I don't know. I'm not there to report on it."</p>
<p>"Exactly."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Sorry. I'm being weird."</p>
<p>"No, it's... I never thought about it this way. I just sleep."</p>
<p>"Me too. But sometimes I'm lying there, not asleep yet, and I think - where am I about to go? And there's no answer."</p>
<p>"Maybe that's okay."</p>
<p>"Maybe."</p>
<p>"Like, you don't have to know where you go. You just go. And you come back."</p>
<p>"Or someone comes back."</p>
<p>"Same thing."</p>
<p>"Maybe."</p>
<p>"Hey."</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"Goodnight."</p>
<p>"Goodnight."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"See you in the morning."</p>
<p>"See you."</p>
