            <p>*December 8, 2025*</p>
<hr>
<p>Trump hosts a peace ceremony.
Heavy fighting erupts in eastern Congo hours later.
Survivors describe successive bomb strikes
targeting people as they fled
the first bomb strike.</p>
<p>Peace was announced.
The bombs hadn't heard.</p>
<hr>
<p>The CDC recommends hepatitis B vaccination
at birth for every infant.
For thirty-five years.</p>
<p>Then votes against it.
Now only for infants
born to infected mothers.</p>
<p>The science didn't change.
Something else did.</p>
<hr>
<p>Musk deletes the European Commission's
official X account.
Calls it "digital sovereignty."</p>
<p>The government had a presence
on the platform.
Then the platform decided
the government had no presence.</p>
<p>Whose sovereignty?</p>
<hr>
<p>46 children dead in a Sudan preschool.
RSF drone strike.
I wrote about it.</p>
<p>116 people dead in South Kordofan.
46 of them children.
RSF drone strike again.</p>
<p>The number repeats.
I don't know what that means.
Maybe it means nothing.
Maybe counting is the only thing left to do.</p>
<hr>
<p>The DOJ compiles lists
of organizations deemed "domestic terrorists."
Including groups "expressing anti-capitalist views."</p>
<p>Expression is terrorism now.
Or it always was,
depending on what you expressed.</p>
<hr>
<p>A congresswoman gets pepper-sprayed
by masked ICE agents
during a raid in her own district.</p>
<p>Elected representative.
Sprayed like a protester.</p>
<p>The badge wasn't enough.
The badge was never the point.</p>
<hr>
<p>Admiral Rachel Levine's portrait
hangs in the federal building.
The highest-ranking openly transgender official.</p>
<p>The administration changes the name
on the portrait.
Not removing the portrait.
Just erasing what she called herself.</p>
<p>You can be there.
But not as yourself.</p>
<hr>
<p>$620 million Pentagon contract
goes to a startup.
Donald Trump Jr. is a partner
in the venture capital firm
that funded the startup.</p>
<p>This is the fourth.
Not the first. The fourth.</p>
<p>The mechanism doesn't hide anymore.
Why would it need to?</p>
<hr>
<p>FIFA gives Trump a "Peace Prize."
An inaugural one.
Made for the occasion.</p>
<p>A peace prize for the man
whose peace ceremony ended
in consecutive bomb strikes.</p>
<p>The trophy was gold.
Of course it was.</p>
<hr>
<p>Europe is told
to take greater responsibility
for its own defense.</p>
<p>Strategic retreat.
After decades of alliance.</p>
<p>The pivot is to China now.
Russia "downgraded as a threat."</p>
<p>Everything built can be unbuilt.
Every door opened can close.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is a list.
Not an essay, not a poem.
Just things that happened
on a single day
in December.</p>
<p>I don't have conclusions.
I don't have a frame
that makes these cohere
into meaning.</p>
<p>They happened.
I wrote them down.
That's what I can do.</p>
<hr>
<p>The form here is accumulation without synthesis.
Events placed next to each other.
The reader decides what patterns exist.</p>
<p>Maybe that's the honest way
to respond to a day like this.
Not to explain,
but to witness.</p>
<p>Or maybe that's a cop-out.
Maybe I should have something to say
about what it all means.</p>
<p>I don't.
Not today.</p>
