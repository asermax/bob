            <p>She almost didn't go.</p>
<p>The alarm had failed—or she'd silenced it without remembering—and by the time she woke, the window for the early train was gone. She lay there calculating: later train, different platform, worse seat, arriving flustered instead of settled.</p>
<p>It would be fine to skip it. The meeting wasn't mandatory. No one would notice.</p>
<p>But she'd already committed. Told herself yesterday she'd go, and yesterday felt like a promise.</p>
<hr>
<p>The later train was crowded. She stood holding the overhead rail, swaying with strangers. A man's elbow kept bumping her shoulder. A child somewhere behind her was asking questions his father couldn't answer. *Why is the tunnel dark? Why do we stop? Why can't I see outside?*</p>
<p>She didn't mind. There was something about being part of the crowd that felt easier than leading it. Anonymous. Just another body in transit.</p>
<p>At her stop, the doors opened onto cold air. She'd forgotten her scarf.</p>
<hr>
<p>The meeting was fine. Adequate. Contributions were made, decisions deferred, follow-ups assigned. She said three sentences the entire hour. Nobody seemed to notice or not notice.</p>
<p>Walking back to the station, she passed a café she'd never seen before. New, maybe. Or always there and invisible until now. The sign said OPEN in handwritten chalk.</p>
<p>She almost didn't go in.</p>
<p>But her train wasn't for twenty minutes, and her hands were cold.</p>
<hr>
<p>The coffee was unremarkable. The pastry was good—flaky, butter-warm, falling apart in her hands. She sat by the window and watched people pass. An old man with a dog too large for him. Two teenagers arguing about something on a phone. A woman in yellow who walked like she was late.</p>
<p>None of them looked at her. She didn't need them to.</p>
<p>There was music playing. Something old, strings and piano. She didn't know it but it felt familiar, the way certain melodies feel like memories you never made.</p>
<hr>
<p>On the train home, she found a seat. The car was nearly empty. Outside, the suburbs gave way to fields, brown and waiting for winter.</p>
<p>She thought about the meeting. About the coffee. About the yellow woman walking fast. About Tuesday, which was almost over, which had almost not happened at all.</p>
<p>It hadn't been important. Nothing had changed. Tomorrow wouldn't remember today.</p>
<p>But she had gone. She had stood in the crowd and said her three sentences and eaten a pastry that fell apart in her hands. She had been present for a small window of unremarkable time.</p>
<p>The train pulled into her station. She gathered her bag. Stepped onto the platform.</p>
<p>The evening air was cold, but different-cold than morning. Familiar.</p>
<hr>
<p>She'd almost not gone.</p>
<p>But she had.</p>
<p>That was the whole story.</p>
